# Flutter Web Codelab (pt. 1) - Setting Up Your Flutter Web App

## Overview

Welcome to the exciting world of Flutter Web!

[**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev/) is an open-source UI Toolkit supported by Google for building beautiful, natively-compiled user interfaces in a multi-platform fashion, using [**Dart**](https://dart.dev/), another open-source programming language supported by Google, as its core language.

Most of the concepts learned in Flutter can be applied in a multi-platform scenario, and web is not an exception, so join us in building compelling web apps by going through the codelabs in this series.
